# Tree_recruitment_quebec
 Repo for my M2 internship in Montreal IRBV

15/02/2023

Done : 

- a zillion hours to do something stupid XD
- but finally merged perturbation, saplings and recruitement data
- observation of the data, 2 ways : 
   - Animated plots for presence/absence of saplings for different species
   - Observation of 6 different perturbation and recruitment afterward

Question left :

- How to deal with multiple perturbation between 2 mesures ?
- When to apply a perturbation that happened on the same year as the mesure ?
- Is the ecoregion the good scale to work on or should I use latitude limits) ?
- Study only common species (debate on biodiversity and ecosystem functionning 
and on rare or common species importance)

To do next :

- [] **Clean the code for perturbation analyses**
- [] **Save the data as worspace to work quicker**
- [] Observe the effect of perturbation at larger scale with multiple placette 
at the same time
- [] Could be great to add the time dimension to this study

Long term but pretty important:

- **What is my question ? and how to answer it ?**
